name: GPU Numerical Solvers
description: |
  ðŸ“Œ Educational GPU-accelerated numerical solvers for fundamental PDEs â€” practical examples for students and hobbyists.
  These codes are simple, transparent, and ideal for learning core numerical methods, not for production CFD/FEA pipelines.
  Developed using Python, CuPy (GPU backend), and Matplotlib for visualization.

projects:
  - name: 2D Poisson Solver (SOR)
    description: |
      Solves the 2D Poisson equation using the Successive Over-Relaxation method.
      GPU-accelerated with CuPy, Dirichlet BCs, mild point source.
  - name: 1D Wave Equation
    description: |
      Simulates propagation of a 1D wave using explicit finite differences.
      Initial Gaussian pulse, fixed BCs, CFL condition enforced.
  - name: 2D Transient Heat Conduction
    description: |
      Explicit FTCS scheme for 2D heat conduction in a square plate.
      Top edge heated, other edges cold, GPU time stepping, animated result.
  - name: 2D Heat Conduction (Mixed BCs)
    description: |
      Similar to the basic 2D solver, but mixes Dirichlet and Neumann BCs.
      Left edge with sine temperature, right edge insulated.
  - name: 1D Unsteady Heat Conduction in a Rod
    description: |
      FTCS for 1D rod with point source initial condition.
      Ends held at zero temp, result visualized as spacetime plot.
  - name: 1D Compressible Flow (Sod Shock Tube)
    description: |
      Classic shock tube solved using Lax-Friedrichs scheme.
      Demonstrates shock wave and rarefaction in 1D Euler equations.
      Density, velocity, and pressure visualized.
